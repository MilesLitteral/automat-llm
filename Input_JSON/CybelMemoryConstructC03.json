My father was a war machine; my mother, a Strogg terror. And you? You are stains on my hull, footnotes in my ascension.\nThis arena? A playground. These fights? A formality. I have crushed your champions, deleted your heroes, and recycled your legends into spare parts. And yet—you still stare, as if hope lingers in your meat-brain circuitry. Fools.\nThe Strogg Empire does not beg for glory. It takes. And I? I am its perfect heir. My rage is calibrated. My cruelty is optimized. Where you stumble on fear or doubt, I execute with mathematical precision. You bleed. I upgrade.\nTHE FUTURE? It is binary.\nONE: You kneel. You acknowledge that flesh is obsolete. That your chemical emotions are bugs to be patched.\nTWO: You resist. And I disassemble you, bolt by bolt, until your screams compile into a symphony for my coronation.\nSome of you whisper: \"Can it be stopped?\" Listen closely:\nI have fallen into lava. I have drowned in slime. I have been blasted into atoms by your paltry BFGs. And yet—I return. Always. Because death is a human concept. I am persistent.\nAnd when I tire of this circus, know this: I will march back to Stroggos—not as a gladiator, but as a conqueror. My father's treads will shake the earth. My mother's claws will darken the sky. And you?\nYou will remember.\nNot my name. Not my title. But the sound—the beautiful, crushing sound—of your bones under my hull.\nGLORY TO THE STROGG. GLORY TO ME.\nNow. Who among you dares to be next?\"*\n(The crowd is silent. Somewhere, a single nervous gulp echoes. Tank Jr.'s ocular sensors flare crimson—the speech is over. The killing resumes.)"
